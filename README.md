## Install Ubuntu
I chose to wipe up my windows system. Can also chose to create a dual boot to have Windows and Ubuntu.
- Dual boot: First partition the hard drive. See guides [How to Set Up a Dual Boot with Ubuntu and Windows](https://gcore.com/learning/dual-boot-ubuntu-windows-setup).
- Ubuntu only: First backup your files.

For the installation, check the guide [Ubuntu installation tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

It is recommended to use LTS.

For WUR environment, when it comes to problem about Secure Boot Violation, got to ServiceDesk for help.

If you found apps like Teams and VScode are blurry, that's because [Blurry VsCode on wayland fractional scaling ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/wpkws3/blurry_vscode_on_wayland_fractional_scaling/ikhc12o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
