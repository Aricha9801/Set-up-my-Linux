# Set-up-my-Linux
As a beginner of Linux, this guide shows how did I set up my Linux system (Ubuntu 24.04) step by step.

> Working institute: ISRIC<br>
> Device: ThinkPad-T14-Gen-4, previous system: Windows 11<br>

## Install Ubuntu
I chose to wipe up my windows system. Can also chose to create a dual boot to have Windows and Ubuntu.
- Dual boot: First partition the hard drive. See guides [How to Set Up a Dual Boot with Ubuntu and Windows](https://gcore.com/learning/dual-boot-ubuntu-windows-setup).
- Ubuntu only: First backup your files.

For the installation, check the guide [Ubuntu installation tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)

It is recommended to use LTS.

For WUR environment, when it comes to problem about Secure Boot Violation, got to ServiceDesk for help.
